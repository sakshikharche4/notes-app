The Notes App is a simple and elegant React-based application that allows users to create, view, and delete personal notes efficiently. It provides a clean and responsive interface built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, ensuring both functionality and modern design.

Users can add a note by entering a title and description. Once added, notes appear row-wise in colorful sticky-note style cards, making them visually appealing and easy to organize. Each note includes a delete button for quick removal. The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience.

This project demonstrates core React concepts such as:

State management using useState

Form handling and controlled components

Dynamic rendering with map()

Component styling using Tailwind CSS classes

Overall, the app combines simplicity with interactivity — a great beginner-friendly React project to practice CRUD-like functionality and responsive UI design.
